# Decision-Trees

For the following exercise, I will use a dataset containing mushroom data agaricus-lepiota.csv.
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one (=there are only two classes edible and poisonous).

In this project I will perform the following:
1. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.
2. Construct a decision tree algorithm.
3. Prune the tree to achieve better results.
4. Visualize the results.
